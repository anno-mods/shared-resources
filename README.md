## Contribution Guide

Shared mods in this repository may be by many others. Strict rules are needed to not harm them:

- No modifications that change vanilla gameplay.
- Modifications that will be seen by all players (e.g. pools) have to include all translations.
- Size should be kept as small as possible. Shared mods will be repeated in every Mod that is using it.
- No modloader warnings.

If your shared mod follows different rules, is very big or only useful for a few then simply linking it in the above mods section may be the better choice.
